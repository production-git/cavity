# CLAUDE.md

## Run the app

Use the no-cache dev server (prevents stale module cache after edits):
```bash
python3 app/serve.py
# open http://localhost:8080/
```

## Architecture

```
app/
  index.html   — UI layout
  index.js     — Entry point, animation loop
  state.js     — State, undo/redo, CIF/JSON I/O, cavity detection
  renderer.js  — Canvas 2D drawing, hit testing (no state mutation)
  ui.js        — DOM events, modal management
  math3d.js    — Pure vector/geometry (no side-effects, no imports)
  styles.css   — CSS variables + component styles
  app.js       — Legacy monolith (not loaded; reference only)
```

**Dependency direction (no cycles):**
```
math3d.js ← state.js ← renderer.js ← ui.js ← index.js
```

### Key functions
- `state.js` — `getCavitySpheres()`, `parseCIF()`, `serializeStructure()`, `loadStructureFromJSON()`, `saveState()`, `restoreState()`
- `renderer.js` — `draw()`, `hitTest()`, `hitBondTest()`, `hitCavityTest()`
- `ui.js` — `init()`
- `math3d.js` — `rotatePoint()`, `convexHull3DFaces()`, vector ops (`v3sub/add/scale/cross/dot/norm/dist`)

### JSON model format
```json
{
  "version": 9,
  "atoms": [{ "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0, "t": "Cu", "role": "Cu", "plane": "cu-o", "id": 0 }],
  "bonds": [{ "a": 0, "b": 1, "dashed": false }]
}
```
- `t` = element symbol; `role` = semantic role; `plane` = highlight group (`cu-o`, `carb`, `ring`, `""`)
- Coordinates: Cartesian, centred at origin, max radius ≤ 10

## Scripts
```bash
python scripts/cif_to_json.py <input.cif> <output.json>
cd scripts && python -m unittest test_cif_to_json -v
```

## Documentation

```
Docs/
  application_design.md     — Full architecture reference
  strategy.md / roadmap.md  — Product strategy and phased delivery
  progress.md               — Changelog (maintain this — see rules below)
  phase-2/                  — Phase 2 PRD and technical design
  feature_plans/
    planned-features.md     — Master feature tracking (add here first)
    cavity-preset-plan.md   — COMPLETED
    [other feature files]   — One file per complex feature
    user_feedback/raw.md
  3d-presentation-app/      — Separate future app (not this codebase)
```

**New features:** add entry to `feature_plans/planned-features.md` first. Complex features get their own file.

**`Docs/progress.md` rules:**
- **Before starting:** add a dated entry with what's planned.
- **While working:** append bullets describing what shipped and key implementation details.
- **Phase complete:** compress daily entries into one summary line under "Completed".
- Keep it lean — scannable changelog, not a dev diary.

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**Use graph tools BEFORE Grep/Glob/Read.** Faster, cheaper, gives structural context.

| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `semantic_search_nodes` / `query_graph` | Exploring code, tracing callers/callees/imports/tests |
| `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` | Code review |
| `get_impact_radius` / `get_affected_flows` | Blast radius of a change |
| `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities` | High-level structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read only when the graph doesn't cover it.

## Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)

**Always follow TDD for all code changes:**

1. Write test first (RED) — test must fail before any implementation
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) — just enough to pass the test
3. Refactor (IMPROVE) — clean up while keeping tests green
4. Verify coverage ≥ 80%

**Test files live in `app/tests/`:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/` — pure functions (`math3d.js`, `state.js` helpers)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` — canvas rendering, hit testing
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` — full user workflows via Playwright

Use the `/tdd` skill when writing new features or fixing bugs. Use `/e2e-testing` for critical user flow coverage.

## Skills

Use the `Skill` tool to invoke these when the task matches:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|------------|
| `tdd` | New features, bug fixes, refactoring — enforces write-tests-first workflow |
| `threejs` | Any work involving Three.js — scene setup, geometry, materials, lighting, cameras, animation, shaders |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | Frontend UI/UX design work — layouts, components, visual design, interaction patterns, accessibility |
| `shadertoy` | GLSL fragment shaders, ray marching, SDFs — Phase 4 DFT isosurfaces and electron density rendering |
| `scientific-visualization` | Publication-quality charts with matplotlib/seaborn/plotly — Phase 2 structural analysis and pore characterization |
